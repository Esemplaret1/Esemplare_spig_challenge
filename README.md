# Thomas Esemplare Challenge Submission

## React Version

I've taken some time to mess around with this and have submitted something that I'm confident will hit the marks you're looking for! It runs similarly to the base project, so for the sake of Less-Is-More, I'm keeping most of the instructions intact.

## Development environment

This application is a default application created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) setup with basic data fetching. Feel free to change the data fetching logic any way necessary to complete this assignment. I'm amped to explain my decisions on how to fetch the data and manage the state.

### System dependencies

- Yarn 1.22


### Install the dependencies

```shell

```


### Start the server locally
